    <!-- <sub>Recipe by J. Kenji Lopez Alt</sub> -->
    <br /><br />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 rack (2.5 to 4 lbs) pork ribs (the one I used was about 3 lbs / 1.4
        kg)
      </li>
      <ul>
        Dry Rub
        <li>1/2 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon (or chile powder)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon five spice powder</li>
      </ul>

      <li>BBQ Sauce</li>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic , grated</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon 5 spice powder</li>
        <li>6 to 10 drops red food coloring (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        (Optional) Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs by loosening
        one end with a knife, and then tearing it away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare a large piece of foil (at least 2” / 5 cm bigger than the ribs
        on all sides) to layer over a baking sheet.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place the ribs back side up onto the foil. Combine the dry rub
        ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle evenly over the back of the ribs and rub in. Flip the ribs and
        sprinkle on the top side, rub in the spice again. Set aside to marinate
        briefly while preheating the oven to 275°F (135°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Mix well. Once the
        oven is heated, brush a thin layer of sauce all over the ribs. Place
        another piece of foil over the top. Crimp the bottom foil over the top
        foil and fold a few times to create a sealed parcel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the ribs in the oven and bake for 2 to 3 hours depending on their
        size. Once done, you can use a thermometer or a fork to poke through the
        foil to test the doneness. The meat should feel very tender or read at
        least 160°F/71°C.
      </li>
      <li>
        While cooking, prepare a baking tray lined with foil (or parchment
        paper) and a rack on top. Remove the ribs from the oven and turn the
        heat up to 450°F (230°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully open the parcel and move the ribs to the prepared baking tray.
        You might need to use 2 spatulas to help with this step because the ribs
        are extremely tender and might fall apart. Generously brush the top and
        back of the ribs with the sauce, leaving a few tablespoons for after
        cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the ribs to the oven and bake until beginning to char, 10 to 15
        minutes. Check on the ribs every 5 minutes to prevent them from burning.
        Remove the ribs from the oven and brush with a thin layer of sauce. Let
        cool for 10 minutes then slice the ribs and serve hot with the remaining
        sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
